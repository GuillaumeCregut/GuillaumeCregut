# Guillaume CrÃ©gut

## Who am I ?

I started code hen learning, at school electronic, and by the way I begin to code with motorola assembly, then C.

Then I decided to continue my learning with Borland Delphi (Pascal object) to produce some softwares for my needs.

After some times, and due to windows changes, I migrate some of thoses software in PHP. Here, I put a foot in a track that bring me, little by little to the web development, learning JS, HTML.

I then jump into full JS applications with node and React.

Now, I teach JS and PHP, to share my knowledge, but I still continue to develop personals projects.
